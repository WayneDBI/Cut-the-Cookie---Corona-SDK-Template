Cut the Cookie is a template based on the famous Cut the Rope smash hit game. From this template you’ll be able to build dozens of games using the mechanics inside. Simply add your SWEET or COOKIE, position the stars and some ropes – and off you go. The template includes a WORLD SELECTION followed by a LEVEL SELECTION system, so you can have hundreds of levels for your game/users.

Add and position AUTO ROPES that automatically connect when the sweet gets close, collect, track, record your STARS collected progress and have all the data for every level of every world saved as you go.

For this template we created our main hero using the amazing SPINE ANIMATION tool, with all the other sprites being packed together inside a Spritesheet. But don’t worry, in the download you get ALL of the separate images and all of our SPINE animation files, so you can quickly change the art over for yours.

The template has loads of features to help make your game stand out – we’re sure you can think of loads of games and themes for this template!
